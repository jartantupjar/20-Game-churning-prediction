time to event
for classification:
every record store

	'time since last purchase'
	'avg time between purchases'
	'days since first played'


for time series:
	convert each user to one row/feature vector
	sum the scores for a time frame of ~10min 
		for specified time(op days)
	use cp days to determine if user is churned or not
	~ends up having the same problem



indefinite cp days:
	instead of specifying a cp days, determine if he will ever continue in the future, if true , it could be binary or count.

future study:
	clustering of users to determine types of users., then build a model for each type of user.
	-this would work if we want to make our models less generalu
