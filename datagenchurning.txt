OP =days(period)
eg. if player hasnt played for OP days =churn

group input by period?
	challenges

time difference between games per record, if time exceeds OP days then that record is churn.

churner=not played/visit  Time record-1
active vs inactive

	op=getrecords(where time within <5days)(startime=first game,end time=5 days)
	cp=getrecords(where time within 10 days after op)(startime=6th day-10days)
every record has churn output?

time difference between game

group by day
